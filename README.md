# CryptoClustering
 
# Description
In this challenge I was tasked with using unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour and 7-hour price changes. 

# Procedure
The starter code gave me a dataframe containing cryptocurrencies and their price changes at different intervals.

I prepared the data and clustered the data using the k-means method, followed by the PCA method.

Then I visualized composites of the models to compare them.

I used the 19.3 activity as a basis for my solution to this challenge.
